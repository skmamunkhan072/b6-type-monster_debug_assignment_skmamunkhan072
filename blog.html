                    Difference in local storage and session storage
                  </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    localStorage - use for long term use. sessionStorage - use
                    when you need to store somthing that changes or somthing
                    temporar.The only difference is that localStorage has a
                    different expiration time, sessionStorage will only be
                    accessible while and by the window that created it is open.
                    localStorage lasts until you delete it or the user deletes
                    it. Lets say that you wanted to save a login username and
                    password you would want to use sessionStorageover
                    localStorage for security reasons (ie. another person
                    accessing their account at a later time). But if you wanted
                    to save a user's settings on their machine you would
                    probably want localStorage. All in all:

                    What is difference between global scope and block scope?
                  </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by
                    the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the
                    global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if
                    statements, for statements, and the like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is the difference between block scope and function
                    scope in JavaScript? Function scoped variables: A function
                    scoped variable means that the variable defined within a
                    function will not accessible from outside the function.
                    Block scoped variables: A block scoped variable means that
                    the variable defined within a block will not be accessible
                    from outside the block.

                    How does javascript event loop work
                  </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom
                    understood concepts or terms in JavaScript. The EVENT LOOP!.
                    Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript,
                    but why does a code running asynchronously really mean? i.e.
                    The Event Loop The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to
                    monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event
                    from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                    effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in
                    the Event Loop

                    1. variable that is nt initialized will give undefined 2.
